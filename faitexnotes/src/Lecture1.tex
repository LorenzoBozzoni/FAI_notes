\section{Course introduction}
There will be no online streaming. The course topics are basically the same as the previous
editions of the course so you are welcome to watch the existing recordings that will be available
throughout this course. The list of links to the recordings is available on the course page.

For the topics that are not covered by previous year recordings, or they have substantially
updated, we will provide additional recordings.
Note that these are not new topics. They were already included in the course plan last year, but
we were unable to include them during the previous edition.

The course calendar is available on the instructors’ WeBeep pages (https://webeep.polimi.it/)

\subsection{Evaluation}
Evaluation is based on closed-book written exams with open questions and numerical problems. 
The evaluation assigns up to 32 points
The laude (30 e lode) is assigned when students receive 32 points in the written exam.\\

Sample exams are available on the WeBeep pages of the course. The course is quite new so older exams are partially representative of the questions you should expect in the exam. The textbook is also a good
source of problems and exercises. Students can reject the assigned grade and repeat the exam. All the five exams will be in presence only. There is no other way to pass the exam or increase the grade assigned to the written exam
