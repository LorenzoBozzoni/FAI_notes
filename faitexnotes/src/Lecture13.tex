\subsection{Model checking}
Two algorithms:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Reasoning with truth tables
    \item Exploting satisfiability (DPLL)
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reasoning with truth tables}
Reasoning with truth tables is a form of semantic reasoning, in the sense that it directly exploits the definition of entailment: $\alpha \vDash \beta $ holds when $\beta$ is true in every model that makes $\alpha$ true
In PL, a model is an assignment of truth values (1 or 0, true or false, $T$ or $\perp $) to every
propositional symbol that appears in $\alpha$ or $\beta$ (or both)
Therefore, with $n$ symbols we have 2$n$ different models, which correspond to the rows of the truth table. For every model (row), we compute the truth values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (by recursively computing the truth values of all the subsentences of $\alpha$ and $\beta$). Then we have that $\alpha \vDash \beta$ if, and only if, every model (row) that assigns 1 to $\alpha$ also assigns 1 to $\beta$.\\

Example: \\
Let us consider:
\begin{itemize}
    \item When it rains and it is windy Alice, wears a raincoat
    \item It rains, but Alice does not wear a raincoat
    \item Therefore, it is not windy
\end{itemize}
Propositional representation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R \wedge W \rightarrow RCA$
    \item $R \wedge \neg RCA$
    \item $\neg W$
\end{itemize}
We want to prove ${a,b} \vDash c$.
Here is the truth table:
\begin{center}

\end{center}
This reasoning procedure is sound and complete. It always terminates, making reasoning in PL decidable. However, it is inefficient when many propositional symbols are involved, because it has to compute a table of size $2^n\times M$, where $n$ is the number of propositional symbols and $M$ is the number of subsentences that appear in the premises and the conclusion. Another drawback of reasoning with truth tables is that it is very unnatural, in the sense that the reasoning process is very far from the most usual forms of human reasoning. This may be problematic in those applications in which an artificial agent must be able to justify the conclusions of its reasoning processes in a way that is easily understandable for a human being.

Certain applications of PL require an agent to establish whether a set of sentences $\alpha$ is or is not satisfiable (i.e., whether there is an assignment of truth values to the symbols of $\alpha$ that makes $\alpha$
true).

Note: in general, set $\alpha$ may be finite or infinite; if it is finite, i.e., $\alpha = {\alpha_1, \alpha_2, \dots, \alpha_n}$, then $\alpha$ set is
logically equivalent to the conjunction of its elements, $\alpha_1 \wedge \alpha_2 \wedge \dots \wedge \alpha_n$. In standard AI applications, $\alpha$ is always finite (although it may be very large): therefore, when it is
convenient we can regard $\alpha$ as a single sentence with no loss of generality. The problem of establishing the satisfiability of a set of propositional sentences is known as SAT. Many interesting problems, including establishing propositional entailment, can be reduced to SAT. A (rather inefficient) solution of SAT is given by truth tables: $\alpha$ is satisfiable if, and only if, it has truth value 1 in at least one row of its truth table. A more efficient method is provided by the DPLL algorithm.


\subsubsection{DPLL}
From Davis-Putnam-Logemann-Loveland. Establish whether a set of sentences $\alpha$ is or is not satisfiable. Preprocessing: convert every sentence in \textbf{CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)}. Body of the procedure: from an empty assignment, incrementally try to build a model of $\alpha$ (i.e., an assignment of truth values to the propositional symbols)
\begin{itemize}
    \item if a model is built, $\alpha$ is satisfiable
    \item if the algorithm terminates without being able to build a model, $\alpha$ is unsatisfiable
\end{itemize}

\textbf{CNF (Conjunctive Normal Form)} represents a sentence as a conjunction of clauses, where a clause is a disjunction of literals and a literal is either a propositional symbol or the negation of a symbol. Every sentence of PL can be transformed in an equivalent sentence in CNF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A \rightarrow B \lor C$ becomes $\neg A \lor B \lor C$
    \item $C \rightarrow \neg D$ becomes $\neg C \lor \neg D$
\end{itemize}
A CNF sentence is often considered as a set of clauses (in logical conjunction), which are in turn considered as sets of literals (in logical disjunction): $(\neg A \lor B \lor C) \land (\neg C \lor \neg D)$ becomes $\{ \{ \neg A, B, C \}, \{ \neg C, \neg D \} \}$. 

\textbf{Unit clause}: clause with only one literal; e.g. $\neg C$. Two literals are \textbf{complementary} if they refer to the same propositional symbol but have different "signs", like $\neg C$ and $C$.

Conversion to CNF, consider $A \leftrightarrow (B \lor C)$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Eliminate $\leftrightarrow$, replacing $\alpha \leftrightarrow \beta$ with $(\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \lor (\beta \rightarrow \alpha)$: $(A \rightarrow (B \lor C)) \land ((B \lor C) \rightarrow A)$
    \item Eliminate $\rightarrow$, replacing $\alpha \rightarrow \beta$ with $\neg \alpha \lor \beta$: $(\neg A \lor B \lor C) \land (\neg (B \lor C) \lor A)$
    \item Move $\neg$ inwards using deMorgan's rule $(\neg(\alpha \land \beta))$ is equivalent to $(\neg \alpha \lor \neg \beta)$ and $(\neg(\alpha \lor \beta))$ is equivalent to $(\neg \alpha \land \neg \beta)$: $(\neg A \lor B \lor C) \land ((\neg B \land \neg C) \lor A)$
    \item Apply distributivity law and flatten: $(\neg A \lor B \lor C) \land (\neg B \lor A) \land (\neg C \lor A)$
\end{enumerate}
Essentially a backtracking (depth-first) search over models with some extras:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Early termination: stop when
    \begin{itemize}
        \item all clauses are satisfied $(A \lor B)\land (A \lor \neg C)$ is satisfied by $\{A = 1\}$
        \item any clause is falsified: $(A \lor B)\land (A \lor \neg C)$ is falsified by $\{A = 0, B = 0\}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Pure literals heuristic: if all occurrences of a symbol in yet-unsatified clauses have the same sign, then give the symbol that value:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item in $(A \lor B)\land (A \lor \neg C) \land (C \lor \neg B)$. $A$ is pure and positive, so set it to true
        \item if there is a model, then there is a model also with $\{\dots, A = 1, \dots\}$
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unit clause heuristic: if a clause has a single literal, set the corresponding symbol to satisfy clause:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item in $(A \lor B) \land \neg C$. $\neg C$ must be set to true $\{C = 0\}$
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
Pure literals and unit clauses often propagate to new pure literals and unit clauses: $(\neg A \lor B \lor C)\land (A \lor \neg C)$ with pure literal $\{B=1\}$ becomes $(A \lor \neg C)$, then $A$ is pure literal \dots

The actual DPLL algorithm:
\begin{Verbatim}[numbers=left, frame=single]
function DPLL(clauses, symbols, model) returns true or false
if every clause in clauses is true in model then return true
if some clause in clauses is false in model then return false
P, value <- FIND-PURE-SYMBOL(symbols, clauses, model)
if P is non-null then return DPLL(clauses, symbols - P, model U {P=value})
P, value ←FIND-UNIT-CLAUSE(clauses, model)
if P is non-null then return DPLL(clauses, symbols - P, model U {P=value})
P ← First(symbols); rest ← Rest(symbols)
return or(DPLL(clauses, rest, model U {P=true}),
DPLL(clauses, rest, model U {P=false}))
\end{Verbatim}

Example of DPLL: check if the set of sentences $\alpha = \{A \rightarrow B \lor C, \neg C, A \land B \rightarrow D, C \rightarrow \neg D\}$ is satisfiable. Convert in CNF:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $A \rightarrow B \lor C$ becomes $\neg A \lor B \lor C$
    \item $\neg C$ remains $\neg C$
    \item $A \land B \rightarrow D$ becomes $\neg A \lor \neg B \lor D$
    \item $C \rightarrow \neg D$ becomes $\neg C \lor \neg D$
\end{itemize}

\end{center}
Conclusion: the set of sentences $\alpha$ is satisfiable (because it is satisfied by any complete assignment extending $\{\neg C = 1, \neg A = 1\}$).\\

Another example of DPLL: is the set of sentences $\alpha = \{A \lor B, A \lor \neg B, \neg A \lor B\}$ satisfiable? 
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{../images/13/AnotherExampleDPLL.png}
\end{center}
At least one branch (with $A$ true) is satisfiable: the set of sentences $\alpha$ is satisfiable
If the branch with $A$ true was unsatiasfiable, backtrack and try with the branch with A false
Split on several variables, in general
What if we would like to prove unsatisfiability?
All branches must be unsatisfiable.

The problem of establishing propositional entailment can be reduced to a SAT problem, because $\alpha \vDash \beta$ holds
\begin{itemize}
    \item if, and only if, every models that satisfies $\alpha$ also satisfies $\beta$
    \item equivalently if, and only if, no model satisfies both $\alpha$ and $\neg \beta$
    \item equivalently if, and only if, $\alpha \lor \neg \beta$ is unsatisfiable (by refutation or contradiction)
\end{itemize}
Consider again the previous example in which we want to prove $\{a,b\} \vDash c$. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $R \land W \rightarrow RCA$
    \item $R \land \neg RCA$
    \item $\neg W$
\end{itemize}

    \end{center}
\end{multicols}
Conclusion: the set $\{a,b,\neg c\}$ is unsatiasfiable, therefore $\{a,b\} \vDash c$ holds.\\

\subsubsection{Efficiency}
Naive implementation of DPLL: solve ~100 variables. Improvements:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Variable and value ordering (from CSPs)
    \item Divide and conquer
    \item Caching unsolvable subcases as extra clauses to avoid redoing them 
    \item Cool indexing and incremental recomputation tricks so that every step of the DPLL algorithm is efficient (typically $O(1)$)
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Index of clauses in which each variable appears $+ve/-ve$
        \item Keep track of number of satisfied clauses, update when variables are assigned
        \item Keep track of number of ramaining literals in each clause
    \end{itemize}
    \item Real implementation of DPLL: solve ~10000000 variables
\end{enumerate}
SAT solvers in practice:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Circuit verification: does this VLSI circuit compute the right answer?
    \item Software verification: does this program compute the right answer?
    \item Software synthesis: what program computes the right answer?
    \item Protocol verification: can this security protocol be broken?
    \item Protocol synthesis: what protocol is secure for this task?
    \item Planning next classes
\end{itemize}
